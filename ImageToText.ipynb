question\\n\\nYour English class have been discussing the topic of young people using\\nthe internet.

This\\noften helps teenagers to widen their knowledge and\\nimprove their grades. Another positive aspect of the\\ninternet is that people can practise foreign languages\\nby chatting to friends in other countries. This is also a\\ngood way of keeping in touch with friends and family\\naround the world.\\n\\n \\n\\nOn the other hand, there are also negative\\nconsequences, awe young people become addicted to\\nonline gaming and this can mean that they waste too\\nmuch time playing these games. This can have a\\nnegative effect on their schoolwork, the amount of\\nexercise they get and their social lives. In addition,\\nexcessive internet use can mean that some young\\npeople hardly talk to their families because they are\\nalways on the computer.\\n\\nTO SUMP) spending time on the internet can have a\\nnegative impact on young people, but it also has many\\n\\nadvantages.
